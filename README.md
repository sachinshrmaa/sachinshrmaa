Hi there! My name is Sachin, I'm a computer engineering student at [Sikkim Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.sist.edu.in/Public/Index/Home "Sikkim Institute of Science and Technology"), Chisopani, Sikkim - India.

Apart from studies I like to [build software](https://stipill.in "build software") related to the web and ml. I like to spend my leisure time [reading books](https://www.sachinsblog.in/bookshelf "reading books")(mostly non-fiction), [teaching web development at the basics cohorts](https://thebasics.sachinsblog.in/ "teaching web development at the basics cohorts"), and writing about finance, health, tech, and more at [SachinsBlog](https://sachinsblog.in/ "SachinsBlog").

And once a week I set aside some time to share the things I'm learning through my work, books, and awesome people I meet through my [SachinsBlog Insider Newsletter](https://www.sachinsblog.in/newsletter "SachinsBlog Insider Newsletter")(feel free to join).

If you have questions for me, you can reach out to me either on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/sachinshrmaa "Twitter") or simply mail me at [mail.sachinshrmaa@gmail.com](mail.sachinshrmaa@gmail.com "mail.sachinshrmaa@gmail.com") (don’t forget to add the subject). I respond to every email/tweet I get.
