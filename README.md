Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Sachin and Iâ€™m currently working as an [Intern at KloudOne](https://authnull.com/), where I focus on works related to frontend development. Iâ€™m also pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [SIST (Sikkim Institute of Science and Technology)](https://sist.edu.in/).  
  
Previously, I have also completed my Diploma in Computer Engineering with a distinction grade. Apart from studies and work, I actively build and contribute to open-source projects on GitHub.  
  
Every now and then, I take some time out to teach the skills I know through live cohorts hosted at [The Basics Class](https://www.thebasicsclass.in/).  
  
If you have questions for me, you can DM me either on LinkedIn or simply mail me at mail.sachinshrmaa@gmail.com (donâ€™t forget to add the subject). I try to respond to every email I get.
